Field Binding Retrieval:

Primary: Direct lookup by ID and partition key
Fallback: Query-based search if direct lookup fails


Knowledge Base Search:

Query by action button type and file type
Retrieve top 3 most recent examples
Download content from Blob Storage


Prompt Engineering:

System prompt with O9 development guidelines
User prompt with project requirements
Example code integration for pattern matching


AI Processing:

Call Azure OpenAI with constructed prompts
Handle API limitations and errors
Validate response structure


Result Processing:

Generate unique code ID
